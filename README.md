### Included Variables

- court names (lists scraped from [中国法院网](https://www.chinacourt.org/index.shtml))
- upper level court for appeal
- court codes scraped from [China Judgments Online](http://wenshu.court.gov.cn/). One court code may include multiple court names, because (1) changes in administrative boundaries; (2) there are multiple ways to indicate the same court (e.g., 顺义区人民法院, 北京市顺义区人民法院).
